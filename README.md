# node-red-contrib-later
A node red node for triggering using [later.js](http://bunkat.github.io/later/index.html).

## Whatâ€™s new
* Added function to cancel all timers

## Installation
```bash
$cd
$git clone https://github.com/pauldeng/node-red-contrib-later.git
$cd .node-red/
$npm install ~/node-red-contrib-later/
$cd
```
## Usage

  This node accepts a `msg` and sends it on according to a schedule defined by a string parsed through `later.parse.text()`. In all cases the schedule string in the node schedule string property is used if set.

  If the schedule fails to parse `node.warn()` is called with details of the string and error as reported by the parser, and the `msg.payload` is sent on immediately.

  If the schedule is empty, the `msg.payload` is passed straight through.

  To cancel a running schedule pass in a message with an empty payload with the `msg.later` property from a previously sent sceduled message.

  To cancel all running schedules, pass in a message with an empty payload.

### Payload as an object

  If the payload is an object the property `msg.payload.later` is used as the schedule string if the node doesn't have a schedule property set.

## Examples

  See the [documentation of later.parse.text()](http://bunkat.github.io/later/parsers.html#text) for the format of the schedule string.

  `every 10 seconds` or `at 10:15 am` are simple examples.

### Example flow files

  Try pasting in the flow file below that sends the message every 10th second twice.

  ```json
  [{"id":"b9995d6c.4666a","type":"later","name":"The schedule","schedule":"every 10 seconds","x":384,"y":129,"z":"80e3898c.7f1c78","wires":[["b8f9cfce.47063","4a71efdd.b58e1"]]},{"id":"b9335ee3.46cca","type":"inject","name":"","topic":"","payload":"comes out later","payloadType":"string","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":true,"x":124,"y":130,"z":"80e3898c.7f1c78","wires":[["b9995d6c.4666a"]]},{"id":"b8f9cfce.47063","type":"debug","name":"","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"true","x":620,"y":129,"z":"80e3898c.7f1c78","wires":[]},{"id":"4a71efdd.b58e1","type":"function","name":"Run schedule 2 times","func":"if (msg.later.count >= 2) {\n    delete msg.payload; \n    return msg;\n} else {\n    return;\n}\n","outputs":1,"valid":true,"x":382,"y":248,"z":"80e3898c.7f1c78","wires":[["b9995d6c.4666a"]]}]
  ```

  This flow does essentially the same, but uses a schedule sent in as a property in `msg.payload` as an object.

  ```json
  [{"id":"e28ebddd.1d714","type":"inject","name":"","topic":"","payload":"{\"later\":\"every 10 sec\"}","payloadType":"string","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":true,"x":115,"y":196,"z":"cb2e612f.34d1a","wires":[["64e96677.9b1698"]]},{"id":"64e96677.9b1698","type":"json","name":"","x":262,"y":196,"z":"cb2e612f.34d1a","wires":[["507261e9.af8da"]]},{"id":"507261e9.af8da","type":"later","name":"","schedule":"","x":436,"y":196,"z":"cb2e612f.34d1a","wires":[["d8bf725e.27409","db2fa266.24d06"]]},{"id":"d8bf725e.27409","type":"debug","name":"","active":true,"console":"false","complete":"false","x":593,"y":196,"z":"cb2e612f.34d1a","wires":[]},{"id":"db2fa266.24d06","type":"function","name":"Run schedule 2 times","func":"if (msg.later.count >= 2) {\n    delete msg.payload; \n    return msg;\n} else {\n    return;\n}\n","outputs":1,"valid":true,"x":442,"y":304,"z":"cb2e612f.34d1a","wires":[["507261e9.af8da"]]}]
  ```

  This flow below shows how to set a schedule, cancel all schedules and set new schedule.
  ```json
  [{"id":"369c5e41.915df2","type":"inject","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"","topic":"","payload":"{\"later\":\"every 1 minute\"}","payloadType":"str","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"x":331,"y":395,"wires":[["c01613a5.ac1d9"]]},{"id":"c01613a5.ac1d9","type":"json","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"","property":"payload","action":"","pretty":false,"x":501,"y":315,"wires":[["e98e17a0.bde9a"]]},{"id":"e98e17a0.bde9a","type":"later","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"","schedule":"","x":671,"y":315,"wires":[["33bcea6.b262296"]]},{"id":"33bcea6.b262296","type":"debug","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"","active":true,"tosidebar":true,"console":false,"tostatus":false,"complete":"false","x":851,"y":315,"wires":[]},{"id":"4be6be86.04f38","type":"inject","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"Cancel all timers","topic":"","payload":"","payloadType":"date","repeat":"","crontab":"","once":false,"onceDelay":0.1,"x":121,"y":235,"wires":[["d921bf59.289908"]]},{"id":"d921bf59.289908","type":"function","z":"f5db7e61.e22758","name":"del payload","func":"delete msg.payload;\nreturn msg;","outputs":1,"noerr":0,"x":311,"y":235,"wires":[["c01613a5.ac1d9"]]}]
